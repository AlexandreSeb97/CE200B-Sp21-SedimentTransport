MATLAB Code for Sediment Transport and Deposition in Reservoir Entrance.
### University of California, Berkeley, CE 200B, Environmental Fluid Mechanics II, Spring 2021

## Abstract
This numerical study will be using the provided MATLAB CFD code to study sediment transport and deposition in a reservoir entrance. As the code only covers water columns, the decreasing velocity of the flow at the entrance of the canal is simulated by decreasing the pressure forcing after a certain amount of time steps. The particle-based model is used to look at the behavior of particles in groups of four density ratios while the concentration-based model is used to generate a more general profile of sediment transport and deposition.
